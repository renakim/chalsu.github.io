## BLE gateway

곳곳에 있는 센서들의 데이터를 수집하고 누적 저장하기 위해서는 게이트웨이가 필수적이다.

- BLE to TCP
  - BLE to ethernet
  - BLE to WiFi

### Product

1. BLE to TCP Gateway

BLE to Ethernet Thin Gateway is the data collecor to transmit the BLE(Bluetooth Low Eneregy) data to a cloud server through Ethernet.

2. iNode LAN

iNode LAN gives access to iNode Bluetooth BLE devices in networks with the Ethernet protocol. With this module you can increase the range of iNode Care Sensor sensors in the building or track on-line the movement of iNode Nav.

1. iNode LAN Camera

iNode LAN Camera is a combination of 5MPx camera with JPEG compression and with full BLE functionality (Bluetooth Smart, IoT:Internet of Things). Using the iNode LAN Camera you can easily associate the user identifier iNode Beacon with a recorded image (access control) or start recording when for example iNode Care Sensor #1 raises alarm associated with the opening of the door to the room or sensor iNode Care #5 detects vehicle in front of the gate.
